\section*{Question 1}
\textbf{Recurring engineering costs} are the costs that will occur in a repeating fashion during the production, usually involving fabriction.
These costs are usually descriped in a per unit form.
\\[0.25cm]
\textbf{Non-recurring engineering cost} is the one-time up-front cost 
for research, design, testing and development of a new product.
\\[0.25cm]
As we can see below, the minimum number of units that need to be sold for the ASIC implementation to be cost-effective is 1 million units.
\\[0.25cm]
$C_{FPGA} > C_{ASIC}$
$\Rightarrow \pounds 2 \times N_{units} > \pounds 10^6 + \pounds 1 \times N_{units} $ 
$\Rightarrow N_{units} > 10^6$

\subsubsection*{(a) Symbolic Simulation}

\section*{Question 3}
\subsection*{(a) Proof by induction}
In order to show that $[P,Q]^{n};R = R;Q^n$ for $n>0$, we first have to show that it is $True$ for n = 1.
\\[0.5cm]
Base case: $[P,Q]^{1};R=R;Q^1$
\\[0.5cm]
This is intuitively shown to be true by the given assumption $[P,Q]^{n};R$ which is equivalent.
\\[0.5cm]
Assuming that it is also true for  $n = k > 0$ 
\\[0.5cm]
$[P,Q]^{k};R = R;Q^k$
\\[0.5cm]
We need to show that the same is true for $n = k+1$ 
\\[0.5cm]
$[P,Q]^{k+1};R $
\\[0.25cm]
$= [P,Q]^k;[P,Q];R$
\\[0.25cm]
$= [P,Q]^k;R;Q$
\\[0.25cm]
$= R;Q^k;Q$
\\[0.25cm]
$= R;Q^{k+1}$
\\[0.5cm]
So by induction we have proved that if we know $[P,Q];R = R;Q$ to be $True$, for $n>0$:
\\[0.5cm]
$[P,Q]^{n};R = R;Q^n$
is also $True$
